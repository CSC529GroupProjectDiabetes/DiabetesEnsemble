# DiabetesEnsemble
This is a group project for CSC529: Advanced Data Mining at DePaul University. The objective of this project is to create a ensemble classifier to predict whether an individual is at high risk for having diabetes. We will use the publicly available [NYC HANES data](http://nychanes.org/data/) to build this model. Our inspiration comes from Longfei Han et. al.'s paper, ["Rule Extraction From Support Vector Machines Using Ensemble Learning Approach: An Application for Diagnosis of Diabetes"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6818375/).
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

> import pandas as pd

> data = pd.read_sas('public_v2_042618.sas7bdat')
